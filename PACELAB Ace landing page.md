# PACELAB Ace landing page

My project is going to be to create a landing page for my company's products. We are developing several web-based applications for creating and managing aircraft layouts and catalogs, and I am going to create a site that serves as a portal for all of these products. Additionally I am hoping to expand on this website in the future to include any reference materials, news/updates, and anything else related to our company and products. This will make it easy for our current and potential clients to see what we offer and get all of their information in one place.
