        <ul>
            <li>Name: JiveKernel <u>(updated)</u></li>
            <li><p>Elevator pitch: A product for people who think LiveJournal is just too overburdened with features and users: A new journaling app for users that want a minimalistic feature set that no one much uses but which did help Fletcher figure out a bit of javascript programming.</p></li>
            <li><p>Wireframe: (see picture<b>S</b> above) <s>Hitting the site without login state will present a login popup.</s>  Once logged in, user will see <s>a chronological list of entries of their own (and, if they have any, those of other users they've chose to friend)</s><b> the entries ("kernels of jive") of all users sorted by "Likes"</b> <s>Stretch goals for this project (as also pictured in the wireframe) will be the ability to search for entries and to comment on other users posts</s> <b>Stretch goals were not achieved</b></p></li>
